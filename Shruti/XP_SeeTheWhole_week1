See the Whole (09/17)

Though week #1 was all about setting up the environment, we as a team gave it quite a bit of thought to ensure we set ourselves to succeed in the coming weeks.

Tasks accomplished this week:
•	Extensively looked through all the CS unplugged site to come up with a topic that not only got us excited but was doable.
•	While picking the topic, we also suggested games we could develop.
•	Based on the project topic and multiple game options, we came up with a team name that could directly relate to what we plan to submit in the end
•	Consolidated a spreadsheet to contain team member’s personal info and shared resources/ links to give each team member a holistic view of everything related to this project.

Going forward, we will ensure to:
•	Architect/ Design project before coding to take into consideration all the anomalies that might have missed during requirements.
•	Reuse and recycle code wherever possible to maximize OOP 
•	Think of use cases/ test cases to validate functionality after development.
