Week#7:

•	Currently, the team is coming up together regularly to get pending tasks done. 
•	Integration of the code is done in the meetings itself. Emphasis is given on writing unit tests and testing the code for various test cases.
•	We are also creating and updating the required REST services and hosting them in Docker cloud.
•	Feedback is continuously taken on any new work done in the meeting itself so that there are no delays in doing the changes.
•	There are few glitches in the logics that we are currently trying to resolve. The glitches are mainly about the user interface.
•	Also this week, I have taken the task of implementing the wait condition with a team member in which the game does not start until all the players have joined.
•	Simultaneously, we are individually studying design patterns to implement the same in the project.

Upcoming week:

•	Emphasis is on getting the pending tasks done. I will be teaming with other members to get the multiplayer aspect and GUI done.
•	We will be also discussing on the design patterns if anyone in the team needs help.
