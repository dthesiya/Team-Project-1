Week #4:


•	This week we tried integrating the small pieces of code (base version) that we did as per the discussion. 
•	The stress was on writing the test cases for testing even a small piece of code to implement the test driven approach. 
•	Also we tried planning the work in such a way so that we can reap the benefits of peer programming so as to reduce the feedback loop. 
•	This really helped in getting our work done faster rather than committing the work in github and waiting for the feedback. 
•	Also there was a meeting conducted to review the status of the work done as a whole. 
•	We also decide to change few implementations based on the discussions in the meeting as the code could be optimized more, the same we took a big decision of changing the algorithm. 
•	The team has been very active in implementing the feedback and writing test cases for the same.
•	Also, as per the assigned tasks of UML diagrams, we have had feedbacks as per which the owners will take appropriate actions and modify the diagrams.
