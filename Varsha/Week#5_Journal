•	This week we tried coming up with the planning of activities to be put in for the next phase. Also we held meetings to discuss the tasks pending along with planning the hours required for each task.
•	We chose individual activities based on our strengths and interests to describe the game working clearly.
•	Again I made sure that every team member’s opinion is heard and acted accordingly.
•	Team members were actively taking responsibility of taking feedback from others.
•	Also we tried planning the work in such a way so that we can reap the benefits of peer programming so as to reduce the feedback loop. 
•	This really helped in getting our work done faster rather than committing the work in github and waiting for the feedback. 
•	Also one of the agendas of the meeting was to solve the issue of making the game multiplayer.
•	We also decide to change few implementations based on the discussions in the meeting as the code could be optimized more. 
•	The team has been very active in implementing the feedback and writing test cases for the same.


For the upcoming week :

•	Team’s feedback loop has decreased considerably.But we need to establish a formal channel to give feedbacks
•	Research ways to efficiently accommodate team members’ feedbacks.
