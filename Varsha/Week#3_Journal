Week#3:

•	This week we started working on developing on the idea selected.
•	With required planning, we came together to finally decide on the implementation of the base version of the idea so that we can finalize the theme and idea.
•	Initially, we had decided on the Kruskal’s algorithm for implementing minimal spanning tree but now we have opted for Prim’s algorithm based on everyone’s feedback for the game. (Note: Game can be made more interesting for the students with the finalized idea)
•	We divided the work amongst the members. The team is divided into pairs for each task to decrease the feedback time for the task they are doing.
•	Feedback is taken even for the smallest task done (like the images to be used) for the game so that rework is avoided.
•	Also based on everyone’s experience from the lab assignments, Greenfoot was selected for designing the game.
•	We as a team are taking efforts to ask other members’ opinion to finalize on things that are done so as to reduce the time to redo things.


For the upcoming week:

•	As we are going to start building small modules for the base version, I will suggest everyone to write test cases for the modules so even after they are integrated they can still be tested.
