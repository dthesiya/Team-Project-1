Week#6:


•	This week we advanced into the development of the game.
•	The basic version of the game is ready so now we are focusing on adding features to it like animation, sounds, etc. with the aim of making it more interesting for the students to enjoy and learn.
•	Our service is already running in cloud. We have divided tasks amongst ourselves. Continuous feedback is part of our daily working process with the emphasis on thoroughly testing even the small things added to the code.
•	We have decided to meet early and decided to plan for the next week strategically because of time constraints.
•	Also, I am pairing with different team members for different tasks ensuring the code that is developed is well tested and feedback is received for every added feature.


For the upcoming week:

•	The motive of this week would be to complete the development of the game 
•	Also thoroughly test the game for different scenarios.
•	We are also planning to get feedback from students within SJSU to get feedback from them for the game.
