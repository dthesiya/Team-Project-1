Actvity Name : Minimal Spanning tree

Game Idea: 
2 spies of different country are after a secret of nuclear weapon.The secret is hidden inside a locker.
In front of the locker, there are few nodes and all the nodes are joined by circuit wires. Whenever 2 nodes are joined,
current of specific strength flows through them. The current strength may differ for different pairs of nodes.Also the strengths 
are marked on the circuit board.
The 2 players have to select all the nodes but the total current flowing through the whole circuit should be minimum.
Also there will be a time limit for the players to open the locker.
Once they start, the timer will be started. The one who completes the game first will take the secret with him and the other
will die due to the massive voltage passing through his body.

As per the discussion, we need to decide following aspects of the idea mentioned above:
1. The units to be considered as weights
2. The timer for the user 
3. What exactly multiplayer game means? Does this mean that we ca have 2 players playing the game on 2 different laptops?
    Also how will be the winner decided?
4. Also we need to confirm the idea with the professor.
