Week#8:

•	Currently, the team is coming up together regularly to get pending tasks done. 
•	Integration of the code is done in the meetings itself. Emphasis is given on writing unit tests and testing the code for various test cases.
•	Week started with deciding the design patterns to be implemented by individual team members.
•	Also we had to make significant changes in the user interface of the game to make it look more fluid.
•	Also challenges were faced when refactoring the code for implementing the selected design patterns.
•	But it was made sure that the code is thoroughly tested after implementing the design patterns.
•	At the end of the week we came together to integrate the individually implemented patterns.

Upcoming week:

•	We will be completing the integration of design patterns along with other tasks.
•	Also we have planned on selecting a group of children from library and requesting them to play our game and give us feedback if any.
